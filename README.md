# Shopee UI/UX Heuristic Evaluation  
*Human Computer Interaction Individual Project*

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a full heuristic evaluation of the Shopee e-commerce
platform, conducted as part of my HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) course.
The project evaluates Shopee’s interface using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics
and proposes UI improvements based on real user problems and industry UX standards.

The evaluation covers:
- Interface analysis (layout, navigation, colour scheme, typography)
- Heuristic evaluation across all 10 principles
- Impact analysis for each issue
- Proposed UI improvements with justification
- Supporting evidence from user reviews and industry UX references

### Delivery Delay & Poor Courier Service
User complaints show that Shopee frequently experiences long delivery delays, slow courier response, and unhelpful customer support. This violates the heuristic **“Visibility of System Status”** because users are not given timely updates or accurate tracking information.
